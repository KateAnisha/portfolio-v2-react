                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                After two years as a conveyancer at a law firm, I decided to take a leap and change my career by joining a coding bootcamp. Iâ€™m currently in the process of levelling up my web development skills with Coder Academy in Brisbane, Australia. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon graduation and further into my career I hope to transition into iOS development with a focus on health and medical applications.

                    When I'm not making websites I'm either gaming, drawing or reading.
